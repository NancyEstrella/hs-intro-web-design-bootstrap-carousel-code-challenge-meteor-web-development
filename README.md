# Bootstrap Feature: Image Carousel

Ever see an image carousel on a website? Where you can click through a whole bunch of images without going to a new page and waiting for it to load? Super cool right?!

Image carousels are made with JavaScript, but because Bootstrap is awesome, they have a template for a image carousel that you can plug and play into your own code.

## Files

+ Take a look at `index.html`. We've set this page up with basic `head` and `body` tags, as well as linking the Bootstrap CSS inside the head, AND Bootstrap JavaScript and jQuery right before the closing `body` tag (you always want your JavaScript and jQuery to be the last thing loaded on the page. You wouldn't want animations to start before the page starts loading!).

+ The `js` directory has Bootstrap's JavaScript, which is what we linked to at the end of `index.html`.

## Getting Started

We've set up the files for you. Your job is to 
use the [Bootstrap Documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel). You'll want to save your images for the carousel in the `images` directory.
